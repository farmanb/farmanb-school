    I am a strong programmer with a rich background in mathematics and I have had some experience both in research and real world development during the past four summers.  I have taken a strong interest in both computational mathematics and software design and wish to continue to grow my experience.  I believe my eagerness to learn along with my academic and practical experience will enable me to make a valuable contribution to your company.
