    I am writing to express interest in position SED-191, Junior to Intermediate C++ Developer.  I am very interested in working in a research oriented environment where I can apply my strong computer science and applied mathematics background to solving real-world problems in science and engineering.

    I am a strong programmer with a rich background in mathematics and I have had some experience both in research and real world development during the past four summers.  I have taken a strong interest in both computational mathematics and software design and wish to continue to grow my experience in a research setting.  I believe my eagerness to learn along with my academic and practical experience will enable me to make a valuable contribution to Applied Research Associates.  I very much look forward to an opportunity to contribute to Applied Research Associates' software development teams.

    Please see my attached resume for a more comprehensive overview of my background and other qualifications.  Should you need any additional information, I can be reached on my cell phone at (802) 282-8205, during the day or during the evening.  I can also be reached by e-mail at farmanb@gmail.com.  I am available for an interview or discussion at your convenience and I will be available to begin work on a full time basis by May 16.  Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Blake A. Farman
