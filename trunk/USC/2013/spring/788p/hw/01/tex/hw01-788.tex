\begin{thm}
  Prove that for any prime $p$ other than 2, and any $x \in \Z/p\Z$, the equation $x = a^2 + b^2$ can be solved in $\Z/p\Z$.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $p$ be an odd prime.
    Since the multiplicative group of units, $\left(\Z/p\Z\right)^\times = \Z/p\Z \setminus \left\{0\right\}$, is cyclic of order $p-1$ there exists some element $g$ such that $\left(\Z/p\Z\right)^\times = \left<g\right>.$
    Define a subset of distinct squares $$S = \left\{(g^\alpha)^2 \;\middle\vert\; 1 \leq \alpha \leq (p-1)/2 \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \subseteq \Z/p\Z.$$
    Note that by construction this set has $(p-1)/2 + 1 = (p + 1)/2$ elements.
    %Consider $G = \Z/p\Z$ as an additive group and 
    %Define the set of additive inverses of $S$, 
    %$$S^{-1} = \left\{-g^{2\alpha} \;\middle\vert\; 1 \leq \alpha \leq (p-1)/2\right\} \cup \left\{0\right\}.$$
    
    Let $x \in \Z/p\Z$ be given.
    It suffices to show that there exist elements $s$ and $s^\prime$ of $S$ such that $x = s + s^\prime$.
    Consider the set
    $$x - S = \left\{x - s \;\middle\vert\; s \in S\right\} \subseteq \Z/p\Z.$$
    For any two elements $s, s^\prime \in S$, by left (additive) cancellation and the uniqueness of additive inverses, $x - s = x - s^\prime$ if and only if $s = s^\prime$.
    Hence the set map $S \rightarrow x - S$ given by $s \mapsto x - s$ is a bijection.
    %Thus $\abs{S} = \abs{h - S} = (p + 1) / 2$.
    It now follows that these two sets must have a non-empty intersection; for otherwise we would have $(p + 1) / 2$ distinct elements of $\Z/p\Z$ in each set, and hence $p + 1$ distinct elements in a field of order $p$.
    Now observe that for any element $h$ of $S \cap x - S$ we may write $$h = s = x - s^\prime,$$ for some $s,s^\prime \in S$. 
    Therefore $x = s + s^\prime$, as desired.
  \end{proof}
