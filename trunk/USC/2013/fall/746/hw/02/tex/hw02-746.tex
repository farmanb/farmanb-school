\begin{thm}
  Let $A$ be a ring and $M$ an $A$-module.
  Let $I$ be an ideal of $A$ that is maximal amongst all annihilators of non-zero elements of $M$.
  Prove that $I$ is a prime ideal.

  \begin{proof}
    There exists, by hypothesis, an element $m \in M$ such that $I = \Ann{m}$.
    Suppose that for some $a, b \in A$ that $ab \in I$.
    Assume that $b \not \in I$, so that $bm \neq 0$ and $a \in \Ann{bm}$.
    Observe that if $x \in I$, then
    $$x(bm) = (xb)m = (bx)m = b(xm) = 0$$
    implies that $I \subseteq \Ann{bm}$.
    Hence by maximality, $\Ann{bm} = I$.
    Therefore $a \in I$ implies that $I$ is prime, as desired.
  \end{proof}

\begin{thm}
  Let $A$ be a ring and $I$ an ideal that is maximal amongst all infinitely generated ideals in $A$.  Prove that $I$ is prime.
  
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose to the contrary that there exist elements $a$ and $b$ of $A$ with $a,b \not \in I$, but $ab \in I$.
    Let $\mathfrak{a} = (a) + I$ and observe that, since $I$ is maximal, this ideal must be finitely generated, say $\mathfrak{a} = (g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)$, where $g_i = a_ia + x_i$ with $a_i \in A$ and $x_i \in I$.
    % It is easy to see that this reduces to the ideal $\mathfrak{a} = (a, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$.
    
    Define the set $\mathfrak{b} = \left\{ y \in A \;\middle\vert\; ay \in I \right\}$.
    Observe that for $y, y^\prime \in \mathfrak{b}$ we have 
    $$a(y - y^\prime) = ay - ay^\prime \in I$$ 
    so that $\mathfrak{b}$ is a subgroup of $A$, and for any $a^\prime \in A$, 
    $$a(a^\prime y) = a^\prime(ay) \in I,$$
    which establishes that $\mathfrak{b}$ is an ideal.
    It is clear that $\mathfrak{b}$ contains $I$, so we observe that $\mathfrak{b}$ does not contain a unit, for if $u \in A^\times \cap \mathfrak{b}$, then $ua \in I$ and so $a = u^{-1}(ua) \in I$, contrary to our assumption.
    Note that since $ab \in I$, it follows that $b \in \mathfrak{b}$, and hence the containment is necessarily strict.
    By maximality once more, we have that $\mathfrak{b}$ is finitely generated, say $\mathfrak{b} = (y_1, \ldots, y_m)$.
    
    Now consider the ideal $\mathfrak{c} = (ay_1, \ldots, ay_m, x_1, \ldots, x_n) \subseteq I$.
    Let $x \in I \subset \mathfrak{a}$ be given and write 
    $$x = c_1g_1 + \ldots + c_ng_n  = c_1(a_1a + x_1) + \ldots + c_n(a_na + x_n) = (c_1a_1 + \ldots c_na_n)a + c_1x_1 + \ldots c_nx_n$$% = a^\prime a + c_1x_1 + \ldots c_nx_n$$ 
    for some $c_1, \ldots, c_n \in A$.
    % It follows that $a^\prime a \in I$ and so $a^\prime \in \mathfrak{b}$.
    It follows that $(c_1a_1 + \ldots + c_na_n)a \in I$ and so $(c_1a_1 + \ldots + c_na_n) \in \mathfrak{b}$.
    Hence we may rewrite $x$ as 
    $$x = a(d_1y_1 + \ldots + d_my_m) + c_1x_1 + \ldots c_nx_n \in \mathfrak{c}$$
    for some $d_i \in A$.
    This establishes the reverse inclusion, $I \subseteq \mathfrak{c}$.
    However, this contradicts the assumption that $I$ is not finitely generated.
    Therefore one of $a \in I$ or $b \in I$ must hold, and thus $I$ is prime.
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  In a ring $A$, let $I$ be an ideal which is maximal amongst non-principal ideals.
  Prove that $I$ is a prime ideal.
  
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose to the contrary that $ab \in I$, but $a,b \not \in I$.
    Let $\mathfrak{a} = (a) + I$.
    By maximality, it follows that there exists some $\alpha \in A$ with $\mathfrak{a} = (\alpha)$.
    Let $\mathfrak{b} = \left\{x \in A \;\middle\vert\; x\alpha \in I \right\}$.
    Observe that if $x, x^\prime \in \mathfrak{b}$ and $y \in A$, then
    $$\alpha(x - x^\prime) = \alpha x - \alpha x^\prime \in I$$
    implies $(x - x^\prime) \in\mathfrak{b}$ and    
    $$\alpha(yx) = y(\alpha x) \in I$$
    establishes that $\mathfrak{b}$ is an ideal of $A$ containing both $b$ and $I$.
    Hence by maximality, there exists some $\beta \in A$ with $\mathfrak{b} = (\beta)$.
    
    Consider the ideal $\mathfrak{c} = (\alpha\beta)$ contained in $I$.
    For $x \in I \subset \mathfrak{a}$ we have $x = s\alpha$ for some $s \in A$.
    But then we have $s \in \mathfrak{b}$, from which it follows that, for some $t \in A$,
    $$x = (t\beta)\alpha = t(\alpha\beta) \in \mathfrak{c}.$$
    Hence $I = \mathfrak{c}$, contrary to the assumption that $I$ is not principal.
    Therefore one of $a, b \in I$ must hold and so $I$ is prime.
%    Since $I \subset \mathfrak{a}$, it follows from maximality that $\mathfrak{a} = (a^\prime a + i)$ for some $i \in I$ and some $a^\prime \in A$.

%    Let $\mathfrak{b} = \left\{x \in A \;\middle\vert\; ax \in I\right\}$, which is an ideal containing $I$.
%    The containment is strict since $b \in \mathfrak{b}$, so there exists by maximality some $\beta \in A$ with $\mathfrak{b} = (\beta)$.
%    Consider the ideal $\mathfrak{c} = (a\beta)$.
%    Since $a \beta \in I$ we observe that $\mathfrak{c} \subseteq I$.
%    Let $x \in I \subset a$ and write
%    $$x = (a^\prime a + i)s = (a^\prime s)a + is$$ 
%    for some $c \in A$.
%    It then follows that $a^\prime s = x - is\in \mathfrak{b}$, so we can write $a^\prime s = t\beta$.
%    But also, $I \subseteq \mathfrak{b}$ implies that $i = r\beta$.
%    Hence $x = (t\beta)a + (r\beta)s = $
  \end{proof}
