\begin{thm}\label{ex1}
  Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ denote positive integers.
  Prove each of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
    $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ implies $a \mid c$.
  \item
    $ac \mid bc$ implies $a \mid b$.
  \item
    $a \mid b$ and $c \mid d$ implies $ac \mid bd$.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      Since $b \mid c$ and $a \mid b$ we have $c = bm$ and $b = an$ for some integerse $m$ and $n$.
      Therefore $c = bm = anm$ implies $a \mid c$.
    \item
      Write $bc = (ac)m = (am)c$ for some integer $m$.
      Subtracting $(am)c$ from both sides we obtain
      $$0 = bc - (am)c = (b - am)c$$
      which implies $b = am$ since $c$ is not zero.
      Therefore $a \mid b$.
    \item
      For some integers $m$ and $n$, write $b = am$ and $d = cn$.
      Then $bd = (ac)mn$, which implies $ac \mid bd$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}\label{ex2}
  Prove that if $n$ is an integer at least as large as $2$ which is composite, then $n$ has a prime divisor which is at most $\sqrt{n}$.

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose to the contrary that all the prime factors of $n$ are strictly larger as $\sqrt{n}$.
    Since $n$ is composite, there exist at least two primes $p$ and $q$, not necessarily distinct, dividing $n$.
    Then for some integer $m \geq 1$ we have
    $$n = pqm > (\sqrt{n})^2 = n$$
    a contradiction.
    Therefore $n$ has a prime divisor which is at most $\sqrt{n}$.
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}\label{ex3}
  Observe that $n^4 + 4^n$ is prime for $n = 1$.
  Prove that $n^4 + 4^n$ is composite if $n$ is an integer strictly larger than 1.

  \begin{proof}
    First observe that if $n$ is even, then $2 \mid n^4 + 4^n$ implies $n^4 + 4^n$ is not composite.
    Assume that $n$ is an odd integer at least as large as 3, and note that $n+1/2$ is thus an integer.
    Hence
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      n^4 + 4^n &=& (n^2)^2 + (2^n)^2\\
      &=& (n^2 + 2^n)^2 - 2(n^2)2^n\\
      &=& (n^2 + 2^n)^2 - n^2 2^{n+1}\\
      &=& (n^2 + 2^n)^2 - (n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^2\\
      &=& (n^2 + 2^n - n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})(n^2 + 2^n + n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}).
    \end{eqnarray*}
    It remains to show that neither of the factors are 1.
    Observe that since $n \geq 3$ we have
    $$n^2 + 2^n + n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} \geq 29.$$
    Suppose to the contrary that 
    $$n^2 + 2^n - n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} = 1$$
    so 
    $$n^4 + 4^n = n^2 + 2^n + n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} = 1 + 2n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}.$$
    With some elementary calculus, it is easy to see that $n \leq 2^{\frac{n+1}{2}}$ holds for $n \geq 3$.
    Combined with the observation that $2^{n-1} \geq 4$ we have
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      n^4 + 4^n &=&  1 + 2n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}\\
      &\leq& 1 + 2(2^{n+1})\\
      &\leq& 1 + 2^{n-1}2^{n+1}\\
      &=& 1 + 4^n
      %&=& 1 + (2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^3\\
      %&\leq& 1 + (2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^4\\
      %&=& 1 + 4(4^n)\\
    \end{eqnarray*}
    which implies $n^4 \leq 1$, a contradiction.
    Therefore $n^4 + 4^n$ is composite.
%    \begin{eqnarray*}
%      1 &=& (n^2 + 2^n - n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^2\\
%      &=& (n^2 + 2^n)^2 - 2(n^2 + 2^n)n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} + (n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^2\\
%      &=& (n^2 + 2^n)^2 - (n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^2 - 2(n^2 + 2^n)n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} + 2(n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})^2\\
%      &=& n^4 + 4^n - 2n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}((n^2 + 2^n) - n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}})\\
%      &=& n^4 + 4^n - 2n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}
%    \end{eqnarray*}
%    from which it follows that $n^4 + 4^n = 1 + 2n2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}} < n^2 + 2^n + n 2^{\frac{n + 1}{2}}$.
  \end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{ex5}
  A large furniture store sells 6 kinds of dining room suites, whose prices are $\$231$, $\$273$, $\$429$, $\$600.60$, $\$1001$, and $\$1501.50$, respectively.
  Once a South American buyer came, purchased some suites, paid the total amount due, $\$13519.90$, and sailed for South America.
  The manager lost the duplicate bill of sale and had no other memorandum of each kind of suite purchased.
  Help him by determining the exact number of suites of each kind the South American buyer bought.
  (Don't forget to show that your solution is unique).
