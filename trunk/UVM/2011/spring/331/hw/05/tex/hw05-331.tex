\begin{thm}
  \label{Ex1}
  Prove that if $f$ is meromorphic on an open set $U \subseteq \C$ with only 
a finite number of poles, then $f = g/h$ where $g$ and $h$ are analytic on 
$U$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  \label{Ex2}
  Let $$f(z) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{(z+n)^2}.$$
Prove that $f$ is meromorphic on $\C$ and determine its poles and their orders.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  \label{Ex3}
  A set $S$ is called {\it star shaped} if there is a point $z_0 \in S$ such that
the line segment between $z_0$ and any point in $S$ is contained in $S$.
Prove that a star shaped set is simply connected.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  \label{Ex4}
  Let $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ and $\delta_0,\delta_1$ be four closed curves in $U$,
all of which have the same initial point $z_0$ (for some parameterizations).  
Assume that $\gamma_0$ and $\delta_0$ are
homotopic in $U$ with homotopy given by $\Gamma_0$;
and assume that $\gamma_1$ and $\delta_1$ are homotopic in $U$ with homotopy
given by $\Gamma_1$.
Prove that the product curves $\gamma_0 \gamma_1$ and $\delta_0 \delta_1$ are also homotopic
in $U$ by exhibiting an explicit homotopy in terms of $\Gamma_0$ and $\Gamma_1$
(and showing it is a homotopy).
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  \label{Ex5}
  Let $\gamma$ be a closed curve in $U$ with initial point $z_0$, and let
$\gamma^{-}$ denote its reverse curve.
Prove that $\gamma \gamma^{-}$ is null homotopic
in $U$ (exhibit and verify an explicit homotopy).
\end{thm}
