getJavaFiles and findExcept both use non-relative file names to ensure that 
files with the same name, buried within a tree, don't get double counted since 
class names are taken directly from file names

Also, all directory operations use python's built in os library (os, os.path, etc.),
so they SHOULD work on windows, however, please note that all development was done
on a linux machine.
