To Professor Richard M. Foote, for all your generosity.
Your appreciation for the beauty of mathematics taught me to love the subject, and your wonderful guidance taught me not only how to do it, but to write it.
In all the mathematics I have written, I have always written as though it could appear in a text book.
I can only hope that this piece lives up to that standard.
