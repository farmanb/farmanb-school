\chapter{Noncommutative Projective Schemes}\label{chapter: background on NCP}

%\section{Recollections and conditions} \label{subsection: standard results and conditions}
Noncommutative projective schemes were introduced by Artin and Zhang in \parencite{AZ94}.
In this section, we recall some of the basic definitions and results, as well as conditions that will appear in the sequel.
