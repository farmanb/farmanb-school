\chapter{Graded Morita Theory: A Warmup} \label{chapter: graded Morita}

This section demonstrates how the tools of dg-categories yield a nice perspective on derived graded Morita. Compare with the well-known graded Morita statement in \parencite{Zhang96}. 

In order to utilize the machinery of dg-categories, we must first translate chain complexes of graded modules into dg-categories.
While one can na\"ively regard this category as a dg-category by way of an enriched Hom entirely analogous to the ungraded situation, the relevant statements of \parencite{Toen07} are better suited to the perspective of functor categories.
As such, we adapt the association of a ringoid with one object to a ring from Section~\ref{subsection: dg modules} to the graded situation, considering instead a ringoid with multiple objects.
