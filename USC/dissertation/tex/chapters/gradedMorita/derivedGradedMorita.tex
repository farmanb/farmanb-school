From this construction, we have a dg-enhancement, \(\hproj{\A}\), of the derived category of graded modules, \(\mathrm{D}(\Gr{A})\).
Passing through the machinery of Corollary~\ref{corollary: Toen}, we have an isomorphism in \(\Ho{\dgcat{k}}\)
\[\RHomc{\hproj{\A}, \hproj{\B}} \cong \hproj{\A^\opp \otimes \B}.\]
This allows us to identify an object, \(F\), of \(\RHomc{\hproj{A}, \hproj{B}}\) with a dg \(\A\)-\(\B\)-bimodule, \(P\), which in turn corresponds to a morphism \(\Phi_P \colon \A \to \hproj{\B}\) by way of the symmetric monoidal closed structure on \(\dgcat{k}\).

Following Section 3.3 of \parencite{CS15}, we identify the homotopy equivalence class, \([P]_{\op{Iso}}\), of \(P\) with \([\Phi_P] \in [\A, \hproj{\B}]\).
The extension of \(\Phi_P\),
\[P \otimes_\A - = \widehat{\Phi_P} \colon \hproj{\A} \to \hproj{\B}\]
descends to a morphism \([\widehat{\Phi_P}] \in [\hproj{\A}, \hproj{\B}]\)
and induces a triangulated functor that commutes with coproducts
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
H^0(\widehat{\Phi_P}) \colon \mathrm{D}(\Gr{A}) \arrow{r} & \mathrm{D}(\Gr{B})\\
\quad\quad M \arrow[mapsto]{r} & P \otimes_\A^\mathbf{L} M.
\end{tikzcd}\]
In particular, given an equivalence \(f \colon \mathrm{D}(\Gr{A}) \to \mathrm{D}(\Gr{B})\), we obtain from \parencite{Lunts-Orlov} a quasi-equivalence
\[F \colon \hproj{\A} \to \hproj{\B}.\]
Tracing through the remarks above, we obtain an object \(P\) of \(\hproj{\A^\opp \otimes \B}\) providing an equivalence
\[H^0(\widehat{\Phi_P}) \colon \mathrm{D}(\Gr{A}) \to \mathrm{D}(\Gr{B}).\]

\subsection{A Comparison with the Commutative Situation}

To provide a touchstone for the reader, we interpret the definitions and results when \(A\) and \(B\) are commutative and finitely-generated by elements of weight \(1\). Then, \(A = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I_A\) and \(B = k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]/I_B\) for some homogenous ideals \(I_A,I_B\). So \(\op{Spec} A\) is a closed \(\mathbf{G}_m\)-closed subscheme of affine space \(\mathbf{A}^n\) and similarly for \(\op{Spec} B\). Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be the associated projective schemes. Then, 
\begin{displaymath}
  \op{Spec} A \otimes_k B \subset \mathbf{A}^{n+m}
\end{displaymath}
is \(\mathbf{G}_m^2\)-closed. The category \(\Gr{A \otimes_k B}\) is equivalent to the \(\mathbf{G}_m^2\)-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on \(\op{Spec} A \otimes_k B\) with \(\Tors{A \otimes_k B}\) being those modules supported on the subscheme corresponding to \((x_1,\ldots,x_n)(y_1,\ldots,y_m)\). Descent then gives that 
\begin{displaymath}
  \QGr{\left(A \otimes_k B\right)} \cong \op{Qcoh}(X \times Y). 
\end{displaymath}
