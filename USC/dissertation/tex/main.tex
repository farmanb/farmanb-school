%% The lines above specify a BibTeX style which controls 
%% the appearance of the bibliography and how citations to
%% the bibliography within the text will work.  It is based on the biblatex.sty
%% package and provides a Chicago style, as preferred by the Graduate School.
%% There are other acceptable styles.  Indeed, different academic disciplines
%% have different styles.
%% 
%% The line  \bibliography{references} will cause LaTeX is search for a file
%% called references.bib.  This file could be named differently.  For example
%% \bibliography{henry} would provoke a search for henry.bib.  The
%% file reference.bib (or henry.bib) is one you will have to produce.  It is
%% a BibTeX database of references you use.
%% 
%% There are a number of alternate ways to address your bibliographic needs.
%% See the documentation uscthesisdoc.pdf  for a discussion of the different options.

%%In any case, this  is a good spot to ask LaTeX to load what it needs to handle
%% literature citations and to layout the bibliography.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Finally, here is the meat.  The idea is to compose a 
%%  .tex file for each section of your thesis or dissertation.  
%%  Then use LaTeX's \include command to put them all together.  
%%  Doing it this way makes it easier to change the order of 
%%  exposition as your writing is in progress.  Also it
%%  makes it easy to print out just one section. The \include
%%  command always starts a new page. So every section would 
%%  start on a new page.  If you would like for sections just
%%  to continue, after the appropriate vertical space, on the
%%  current page, then use the \input command instead of the 
%%  \include command.
