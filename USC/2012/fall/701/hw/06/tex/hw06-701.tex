\begin{thm}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      Find all numbers $n$ such that $S_{10}$ contains an element of order $n$.
    \item
      Find all numbers $n$ such that $A_8$ contains an element of order $n$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      Observe that $S_n$ has cycles of all lengths $m \leq 10$.  
      Namely, the identity and the cycles $\left(1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, m\right)$ for $2 \leq m \leq 10$ serve as explicit examples.
      Furthermore, the remaining elements are formed by taking products of disjoint cycles.
      The orders for pairwise products of distinct $i$-cycles with $j$-cycles are given in the table below.
      For any such $i,j$-cycle, a representative can easily be constructed as $(1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, i)(i+1 \; i+2 \; \ldots \; j)$.

      We now observe that the only elements of odd order larger than 10 are 15 and 21.
      Any other constructions would have to be produced from the product of an element of one of those orders with a cycle of relatively prime length.
      Since an element of order 21 already contains 10 elements (it is the product of disjoint 3- and 7-cycles), there are no elements of $S_{10}$ from which it is disjoint.
      However, an element of order 15 may be constructed from a 5-cycle and a 3-cycle.
      Hence $S_{10}$ admits an element of order 30, say $(1\, 2)(3\, 4\, 5a)(6\, 7\, 8\, 9\, 10)$.
      Therefore the $n$ are 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 30.

%\begin{lem}\label{pcycles}
%  Let $p$ be a prime dividing $n$.  A permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ has order $p$ if and only if it is the product of disjoint $p$-cycles.
%  \begin{proof}
%    Let $\sigma = \sigma_1\sigma_2\cdots\sigma_n$ be the cycle decomposition for $\sigma$ with 1-cycles ommitted.
%    Assume $\sigma$ has order $p$.
%    As was shown in class, the order of $\sigma$ is the least common multiple of the lengths of the $\sigma_i$'s, hence the order of each $\sigma_i$ divides $p$.
%    Since the $\sigma_i$ were assumed not to be 1-cycles, each have length $p$.
%    Therefore $\sigma$ is the product of $p$-cycles.
%    
%    Conversely, assume $\sigma$ is a product of disjoint $p$-cycles.
%    Then, by the same result mentioned above, the order of $\sigma$ is the least common multiple of the lengths of the $\sigma_i$.
%    Since each has length $p$, the order of $\sigma$ is $p$.

\begin{thm}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      For all $n \geq 2$, show that $S_n = \left<(1\, 2), (1\, 2\, 3\, \ldots\, n)\right>$.
    \item
      Suppose that $p$ is prime, that $\sigma \in S_p$ is a transposition and that $\tau \in S_p$ is a $p$-cycle.
      Show that $S_p = \left<\sigma, \tau\right>$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      Let $\sigma = \left(1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots n\right)$ and $\tau = \left(1\; 2\right)$.
      Observe that, as was shown in class, every element of $S_n$ may be written as the product of transpositions.
      Hence it suffices to show that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ generate all the transpositions.
      To that end, consider the transposition $\left(i\; j\right)$ and observe that if we conjugate it by $\sigma^{-1}$ then we have
      $$\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^{-1} \left(i\; j\right) \sigma^{-1} = \sigma \left(i\; j\right) \sigma^{-1} = \left(\sigma\left(i\right)\; \sigma\left(j\right)\right) = \left(i+1\; j+1\right).$$
      Hence we may generate the transpositions of the form $\left(i\; i+1\right)$ by successive conjugation.
      Namely, if we let $\tau_1 = \tau$, and define $\tau_i = \sigma\tau_{i-1}\sigma^{-1}$, then we have $\tau_2 = \left(2\; 3\right), \tau_3 = \left(3\; 4\right), \ldots, \tau_{n-1} = \left(n-1\; n\right)$.\footnote[1]{Note also, that these could be generated by conjugation with powers of $\sigma$.  Indeed, it is immediate from the observation that $\sigma^j(i) = i+j$.  Recursion just seemed slightly more natural here.}

      It remains only to show that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ generate the transpositions of the form $\left(i\; i + j\right)$, where $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 < j \leq n - i$.
      These transpositions may be constructed in the following way.
      %Observe first that if $j > i$, then $\tau_j$ fixes $i$.
      Let $i$ and $j$ be given.
      Consider the element $\tau_i = \left(i\; i+1\right)$ and observe that for all $1 < k \leq j$, $\tau_{i+k}(i) = i$.
      By associativity and the fact that transpositions are involutary, we may conjugate $\tau_i$ by the elements $\tau_{i+1}, \tau_{i+2}, \ldots, \tau_{i+j-1}$ in the following way:
      $$\tau_{i+j} \left( \ldots \left( \tau_{i+2} \left(\tau_{i+1} \tau_i\tau_{i+1} \right) \tau_{i+2}\right) \ldots \right) \tau_{i+j} = \left(i\; \tau_{i+j}\ldots\tau_{i+2}\tau_{i+1}\left(i + 1\right) \right).$$
      Now we observe that, by construction, $\tau_{i + k} = \left(i + k \;\; i+k+1\right)$ for $k = 1, \ldots, j$. 
      Hence $\tau_{i+j}\ldots\tau_{i+2}\tau_{i+1}\left(i + 1\right) = i+j$, thereby completing the construction.
      Therefore $S_n = \left<\left(1\; 2\right), \left(1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots\; n\right)\right>$. 
    \item
      First relabel the elements being permuted in such a way that $\tau = (\alpha_1\; \alpha_2\; \ldots\; \alpha_p)$.
      Fix $i,j$ such that $\sigma = (i\; j)$ and observe that if $i > j$, then we may rewrite $\sigma$ as $(j\; i)$.
      Hence it suffices to assume $i < j$.
      As in part (a), we may conjugate $\sigma$ by $\tau$ a total of $n - i + 1$ times to obtain the transposition $\sigma_1 = (\alpha_1\; \alpha_{k})$ where $k = j + n - i + 1$.
      
      Now cycle through the conjugates to obtain the collection of transpositions $$\sigma_1, \sigma_2 = (\alpha_2\; \alpha_{k+1}), \ldots, \sigma_{p} = (\alpha_p\; \alpha_{k-1}).$$
      %\ldots, \sigma_{n-k} = (\alpha_{n-k}\; \alpha_{n}), \sigma_{n-k+1} = (\alpha_{n-k+1}\; \alpha_1), \ldots, 
      Observe that for each $i$, if $\sigma_i$ does not fix $\alpha_j$, then it moves the subscript forward $k - 1$ places, modulo $p$.
      Since every non-zero element of $\Z/p\Z$ generates the group, it is clear that one may then produce a collection of transpositions for which their product applied to $\alpha_k$ is $\alpha_2$.
      Conjugating $\sigma_1$ by those transpositions as in (a) returns us to the case where we have $\tau = (\alpha_1\; \alpha_2\; \ldots\; \alpha_p)$ and $\sigma = (\alpha_1\; \alpha_2)$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  \begin{proof}
    First let $\psi$ be the isomorphism between the multiplicative and additive groups of order 2,
    \begin{align*}
      \psi \colon \left\{\pm 1\right\} & \rightarrow \left\{0,1\right\}\\
        -1 & \mapsto 1\\
        1 & \mapsto 0.\\
    \end{align*}
    Then observe that there is a natural embedding of $S_{n-2}$ into $S_n$ under the inclusion map, so it makes sense to define the map 
    \begin{align*}
      \varphi \colon S_{n-2} & \rightarrow A_n\\
      \sigma & \mapsto \sigma \left( n-1\; n \right)^{\psi\circ\varepsilon(\sigma)},
    \end{align*}
    where $(n-1\; n)^{0} = 1_{A_n}$.
    This map appends a disjoint transposition to any element not in $A_{n-2}$, thus making it an element of $A_{n-2}$, as well as $A_n$ under the aforementioned inclusion map.
    To see that $\varphi$ is well defined, first observe that if $\varepsilon(\sigma_1) = \varepsilon(\sigma_2) = 1$, then $\varphi(\sigma_1) = \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 = \varphi(\sigma_2)$.
    If $\varepsilon(\sigma_1) = \varepsilon(\sigma_2) = -1$, then  we have by the group structure in $A_n$ that $\sigma_1(n-1\; n) = \sigma_2(n-1\; n)$ if and only if $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2$.

    To see that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, let $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in S_{n-2}$ be given.
    If both are elements of $A_{n-2}$, then, trivially, $\varphi(\sigma_1\sigma_2) = \sigma_1\sigma_2 = \varphi(\sigma_1)\varphi(\sigma_2)$.
    If only one is an element of $A_{n-2}$, say $\sigma_1$, then it follows from the fact that disjoint cycles commute that
    $$\varphi(\sigma_1\sigma_2) = \sigma_1\sigma_2(n-1\; n) = \sigma_1(n-1\; n)\sigma_2 = \varphi(\sigma_1)\varphi(\sigma_2).$$
    Similarly, if neither is an element of $A_{n-2}$, then
    $$\varphi(\sigma_1\sigma_2) = \sigma_1\sigma_2 = \sigma_1\sigma_2(n-1\; n)^2 = \sigma_1(n-1\; n)\sigma_2(n-1\; n) = \varphi(\sigma_1)\varphi(\sigma_2).$$
    
    It remains only to show that $\ker\varphi$ is trivial.  
    To that end, let $\sigma \in \ker\varphi$ be given.
    If $\varepsilon(\sigma) = -1$, then $\varphi(\sigma) = \sigma(n-1\; n) = 1$ implies $\sigma = (n-1\; n)$, which is not an element of $S_{n-2}$.
    Hence $\varepsilon(\sigma) = 1$, from which it follows that $\varphi(\sigma) = \sigma = 1$ and $\ker\varphi$ is trivial, as desired.
    Therefore, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $S_{n-2} \cong Im(\varphi) \leq A_n$.
    
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Let $a \in S_n$ be an $n$-cycle.  Show that $C_{S_n}(a) = \left< a \right>$.
  \begin{proof}
    Since $\left< a \right>$ is cyclic, it is certainly contained in $C_{S_n}(a)$.
    To see that it is equal, observe that because elements of $S_n$ are conjugate if and only if they are of the same cycle type, the size of the conjugacy class is $(n-1)!$.
    Then by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, we have $$\abs{C_{S_n}(a)} = \frac{\abs{S_n}}{\abs{cl(a)}} = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!} = n = \abs{\left<a\right>}.$$
    Therefore $\left<a\right>$ is a subgroup of $C_{S_n}(a)$ of the same order, which implies $C_{S_n}(a) = \left< a \right>$.
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Suppose that $1 < m < n$.  Let $G = \left<\sigma = (1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots\; m), \tau = (1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots\; n)\right>$.
  Prove that $G$ contains a 3-cycle.
  \begin{proof}
    First, start by conjugating $\sigma^{-1}$ by $\tau^{-1}$ to obtain
    $$\tau\sigma^{-1}\tau^{-1} = (1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots\; n)(1\; m\; m-1\; \ldots 2)(1\; n\; n-1\; \ldots\; 2) = (2\; m+1\; m\; \ldots\; 3).$$
    Now, multiply on the left by $\sigma$ to obtain
    $$\sigma\tau\sigma^{-1}\tau^{-1} = (1\; 2\; 3\; \ldots\; m)(2\; m+1\; m\; \ldots\; 3) = (1\; 2\; m+1).$$
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Write down the conjugacy classes in $A_4$.
  \begin{proof}
    The conjugacy classes in $A_4$ are $\left\{(1\; 2\; 3), (1\; 3\; 4), (1\; 4\; 2), (2\; 4\; 3)\right\}$, $\left\{(1\; 2\; 4), (1\; 2\; 4), (1\; 4\; 3)\right\}$,\\ $\left\{(1\; 2)(3\; 4), (1\; 3)(2\; 4), (1\; 4)(2\; 3)\right\}$, and $\left\{1\right\}$.
    These can be checked easily by hand by first computing the conjugates of $(1\; 2\; 3)$, then ensuring the last four 3-cycles are truly conjugate and that the 2,2-cycles are conjugate.
    The computations are listed in the table below.
    The column indicates the element which was conjugated by the inverse of the row (i.e. $(\sigma^{-1})^{-1}\tau\sigma^{-1}$).\\

\begin{thm}
  Prove that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose to the contrary that $A_4$ contained a subgroup, $N$, of order 6.
    Then $[A_4: N] = 2$ implies $N$ is normal in $A_4$.
    Let $\sigma$ be any 3-cycle and consider the group it generates, $\left<\sigma\right>$.
    Observe that by the result of Homework 3, exercise 6 (a), $\gcd(\abs{\left<\sigma\right>}, [G : N]) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1$ implies $\left<\sigma\right> \subseteq N$.
    Hence $N$ contains all eight elements of order 3.
    However, $N$ was supposed to have order 6, a contradiction.
    Therefore $A_4$ does not have a subgroup of order 6.
