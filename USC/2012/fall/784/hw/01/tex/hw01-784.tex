\begin{thm}
	Prove that $\sin(1^\circ)$ is algebraic.
	\begin{proof}
	Observe that $2\sin(\pi/180) = 2\cos(89\pi/180)$ is an algebraic integer by the remarks in the notes that follow the first lemma.
	Let $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be the minimal polynomial for $2\sin(\pi/180)$.
	Then the polynomial $g(x) = f(2x)$ also has integer coefficients and has $sin(\pi/180)$.
	Therefore $sin(1^\circ) = \sin(\pi/180)$ is algebraic.
	\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Let $n$ denote a positive integer.  
	Prove that $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}$ is rational if and only if $n \in \{1,2,4\}$.
	\begin{proof}
	\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Using Theorem 2, prove that if $m$ is a positive integer for which $\sqrt{m} \in \mathbb{Q}$, then $m$ is a square (i.e., $m = k^2$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$).
	\begin{proof}

\begin{thm}
	Show that the average of the $x_j^2$'s is independent of the line and find its value.
	\begin{proof}
	With a little computation, we have the identity $$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2.$$
	Using that $\sigma_1 = -a_{n-1}/a_n = -7/2$ and $\sigma_2 = a_{n-2}/a_n = 0$ we obtain $$\frac{1}{4}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2) = \frac{49}{8}.$$
	\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Prove or disprove that the average of the $y_j$'s is independent of the line.
	\begin{proof}
	With a bit of computation, it can be shown that the following identities hold:
		$$x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + x_4^4 = \sigma_{1}^{4} - 4 \sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2} + 2 \sigma_{2}^{2} + 4
\sigma_{1} \sigma_{3} - 4 \sigma_{4} \text{ and }
		x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_3^3 + x_4^3 = \sigma_{1}^{3} - 3 \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} + 3 \sigma_{3}$$
	Using these identities in the equation for the sum of the $y_i$'s and that $\sigma_1 = -7/2,\, \sigma_2 = 0,\\ \sigma_3 = -(3-m)/2, \text{ and } \sigma_4 = -(5 + b)/2$ we obtain
	$$\sum_{i=1}^4 y_i= 2(\sigma_{1}^{4} - 4 \sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2} + 2 \sigma_{2}^{2} + 4
\sigma_{1} \sigma_{3} - 4 \sigma_{4}) + 7(\sigma_{1}^{3} - 3 \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} + 3 \sigma_{3}) + 3(\sigma_1) - 5 = -\frac{7}{2} m + 4 b + 15.$$
	Since $m$ and $b$ vary with the choice of $y_j$, it is clear that the average of the $y_j$'s is not independent of the line chosen.

	\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Prove that $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{2}}{3}\right)}$ is irrational.
	\begin{proof}
	Let $\pi\alpha = \arcsin(\sqrt[3]{2}/3)$ so that $2\sin(\pi\alpha) = 2\cos(\pi(1-\alpha)/2) = 2\sqrt[3]{2}/3$.
	Suppose $\alpha$ were rational and observe then that $2\sqrt[3]{2}/3$ would be an algebraic integer.
	Then by Theorems 2 and 5, we have $(2\sqrt[3]{2}/3)^3 = 16/27 \in \mathbb{Z}$, a contradiction.
	Therefore $\alpha \not \in \mathbb{Q}$.
	
	\end{proof}
