Extract this folder into your dvc folder in:

experimental/dvc3/examples

This will create a folder, hw1, inside the examples folder.

Inside the examples folder, edit CMakeLists.txt and add the line

add_subdirectory (hw1)

Reconfigure the project using cmake, then recompile using either make (linux) or visual studio (windows).  You can now modify the files inside the hw1 directory.  Please note that you must recompile every time you make changes to the XML file or else the changes will not be reflected in dvc.
