  \textsc{Student Success Center}
\end{center}

\noindent
In partnership with UofSC faculty, the Student Success Center (SSC) offers a number of programs to assist you in better understanding your course material and to aid you on your path to success. 
SSC programs are facilitated by professional staff, graduate students, and trained undergraduate peer leaders who have previously excelled in their courses.
Resources available to students include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  \textbf{Peer Tutoring:} make a one-on-one appointment with a Peer Tutor by going to \url{www.sc.edu/success}. 
  If a course is not on the semester’s supported-course list, there is a process for requesting assistance. 
  The full schedule of days/times/locations for drop-in and Online Tutoring hours can also be viewed on the SSC website.
\item
  \textbf{Supplemental Instruction (SI):} attend SI Sessions to focus on the most difficult content being covered in class. 
  SI Leaders are assigned to specific sections of courses and hold three weekly study sessions that can serve as “built-in study time.” 
  The schedule is posted on the SSC website each week and will also be communicated by the SI Leader.
\item
  \textbf{Peer Success Consultations:} make a one-on-one Success Consultation with a Peer Consultant to work on developing study skills, setting goals, and connecting to a variety of campus resources. 
  Your instructor may communicate with the SSC via Success Connect, an online referral system, regarding your progress in the course. 
  If contacted by the SSC, please schedule a Success Consultation. 
  Success Connect referrals are not punitive and any information shared by your professor is confidential and subject to FERPA regulations.
\end{itemize}
SSC services are offered to all UofSC undergraduates at no additional cost.
You are invited to call the Student Success Hotline at (803) 777-1000, visit \url{www.sc.edu/success}, or come to the SSC in the Thomas Cooper Library (Mezzanine Level) to check schedules and make appointments.

  \textsc{Expectations}
\end{center}

\noindent
\textbf{Academic Integrity:} 
\textit{As a Carolinian...I will practice personal and academic integrity.}\\

\noindent 
The University of South Carolina expects high standards in all areas from its students.
The University, as well as the faculty, staff, alumni, and students believe strongly in the Honor Code.
This Code requires acceptance of certain responsibilities and agreement by all students to abide by the spirit of the Honor Code upon entering the University of South Carolina.
In order that you may better understand the required responsibilities, the general University community codes are outlined below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  It shall be the responsibility of every faculty member, student, administrator and staff member of the University community to uphold and maintain the academic standards and integrity of the University of South Carolina.
\item
  Any member of the University community, who has reasonable grounds to believe that an infraction of the Honor Code has occured, has an obligation to report the alleged violation.
  Violation of any of the following standards subjects the student to disciplinary action: improper collaboration, cheating, lying, bribery, and plagiarism.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Your enrollment in this class signifies your willingness to accept these responsibilities and uphold the Honor Code of the University of South Carolina.
Please review the Honor Code via
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.sa.sc.edu/academicintegrity/}
\end{center}

\noindent
Any deviation from this expectation \textbf{will result in a grade of F in the course} and disciplinary action through the Office of Academic Integrity.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Attendance:} 
Students are obligated to complete all assigned work promptly, to attend class regularly, and to participate in whatever class discussion may occur.\\

\noindent
The following events or circumstances are potentially excusable absences:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  participation in an authorized University activity (such as musical performances, academic competitions, or varsity athletic events in which the student plays a formal role in a University sanctioned event),
\item
  required participation in military duties,
\item
  mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school which cannot be rescheduled,
\item
  participation in legal proceedings or administrative duties that require a student's presence,
\item
  death or major illness in a student’s immediate family,

\subsection{Sample Exam}
The following is an exam given to my Calculus II class in July 2014.
\begin{thm}
  Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves $f(x) = 4(x - 2)^2$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7$ about the $y$-axis.
\end{thm}

\textbf{Integration}\\

\noindent For each of the following problems, decide which method of integration is appropriate and compute the given integrals.
You will find some useful trigonmetric identities on the last page.
If you need more space for a problem, use the back of the page.

\begin{thm}
  Compute $\displaystyle{\int\sin^3(\theta)\cos^2(\theta)d\theta}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Compute $\displaystyle{\int \frac{\ln(x)}{x^2}dx}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Compute $\displaystyle{\int\frac{dx}{x^2\sqrt{x^2-9}}}$.

\begin{thm}
  Compute $\displaystyle{\int\frac{x}{x^2 - 5x + 6}}dx$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  Explain why $\displaystyle{\int_0^3 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x}}}$ is an improper integral, then evaluate it.
\end{thm}

\textbf{Series and Sequences}
\begin{thm}
  Express $5.\overline{5} = 5.55555\ldots$ as a rational number. [Hint: Geometric Series.]
\end{thm}

\noindent
Test the following series for convergence.
You may use any of the tests we covered in class, however you {\bf must indicate which test you use}.
\begin{thm}
  $\displaystyle{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2^k k!}{(k+2)!}}.$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{2n}}{n^n}}$
\end{thm}

\textbf{Power Series}
