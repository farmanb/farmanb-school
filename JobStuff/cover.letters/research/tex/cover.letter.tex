  \opening{To the Hiring Committee,}
  
  My name is Blake Farman.
  I am a graduate student at the University of South Carolina, working in the area of Derived Categories in Noncommutative Projective Algebraic Geometry.
  I expect to receive a Ph.D. from the University of South Carolina in May 2018, under the direction of Matthew R. Ballard.
  I am writing to apply for the \position.
  %I am particularly interested in working with \contacts.
  %I believe that my research interests align closest with \contacts.

  %My current research focuses on methods of derived categories in noncommutative projective algebraic geometry.
  %In recent joint work with my adivsor, we have established an analogue of Fourier-Mukai kernels for Artin and Zhang's noncommutative projective schemes.
  %My research is aimed towards importing methods of projective algebraic geometry into the study of noncommutative graded algebras.
  %Please see my research statement for a more detailed treatment of my proposed research program.

  %By the end of my tenure as a graduate student, I will have served as instructor of record for 20 undergraduate level courses ranging from college algebra to calculus II;
  %the specific courses can be found in my curriculum vitae.
  %In addition, I have also spent time tutoring students one-on-one in department sponsored tutoring labs and covered lectures at the graudate level.

  With my application, I include \materials.
  I also include \numresrefs\  letters of recommendation regarding my research from \refs, and \numteachrefs\ letter of recommendation regarding my teaching from \teachingrefs.
  %I also include \numresrefs\ letters of recommendation regarding my research from \refs.

  Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide.
  Thank you in advance for your consideration.
