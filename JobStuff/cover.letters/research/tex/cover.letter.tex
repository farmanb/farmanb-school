  \opening{To the Hiring Committee,}
  
  My name is Blake Farman.
  I am a graduate student at the University of South Carolina, working in the area of Derived Categories in Noncommutative Projective Algebraic Geometry.
  I expect to receive a Ph.D. in May of 2018, under the direction of Matthew R. Ballard.
  I am writing to apply for the \position.
  %I am particularly interested in working with \contacts.

  %For the former, one studies a not necessarily commutative graded ring via an analog of Serre's description for sheaves on a projective variety.
  %For the latter, one focuses on the dg-category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a variety.
  %So for a regular old projective variety, this passage is going from the abelian category of coherent or quasi-coherent sheaves to its derived category.
  %This is what we need to do follow the edicts of physics, to understand deep but subtle connections in moduli theory, and to gain new insights into birational geometry.
%  Consequently, for varieties, an impressive machine has been constructed by Mukai, Bondal, Orlov, Bridgeland, and others to understand the homological algebra in terms of the geometry.
%  In particular, thanks to Orlov (and Toen and Lunts in more generality) we know that any equivalence between D(X) and D(Y) is an integral transform associated to a kernel on the product X x Y.
%  If we think noncommutatively, this is a derived Morita statement and we can ask if it holds for Artin-Zhang noncommutative projective schemes.
%  Blake's result is that (given some standard homological assumptions) it does.
%  This is a consequence of a stronger result on dg-functors between D(X) and D(Y).
%  For more details, please see the enclosed research statement. 

  %My research falls broadly within the realm of noncommutative algebraic geometry. and lies at the intersection of the styles of Artin-Zhang and Kontsevich, which I believe aligns well with the interests of Professor \contacts.

  %My research focuses on methods of derived categories in noncommutative projective algebraic geometry.
  %In recent joint work with my adivsor, we have established an analogue of Fourier-Mukai kernels for Artin and Zhang's noncommutative projective schemes.
  %My research is aimed towards importing methods of projective algebraic geometry into the study of noncommutative graded algebras.
  %Please see the enclosed research statement for a more detailed treatment of my proposed research program.

  %By the end of my tenure as a graduate student, I will have served as instructor of record for 20 undergraduate level courses ranging from college algebra to calculus II;
  %the specific courses can be found in my curriculum vitae.
  %In addition, I have also spent time tutoring students one-on-one in department sponsored tutoring labs and covered lectures at the graudate level.

  With my application, I include \materials.
  I have also arranged for \numresrefs\  letters of recommendation regarding my research from \refs, and \numteachrefs\ letter of recommendation regarding my teaching from \teachingrefs.
