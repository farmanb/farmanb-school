\def\researchblurb{My research lies at the intersection of Kontsevich and Artin-Zhang style noncommutative geometry, where I study the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the noncommutative projective schemes of Artin-Zhang via the framework of differential graded categories.
  My dissertation provides a noncommutative definition of integral transform and proves, under appropriate cohomological assumptions, that to any equivalence between derived categories of quasi-coherent sheaves one may associate an integral transform.
  In the commutative situation, the analogous result is due to Orlov (and To\"{e}n and Lunts in more generality), and forms a corner stone for our understanding of derived categories in algebraic geometry.

%My research lies in noncommutative algebraic geometry, at the intersection of the styles of Artin-Zhang and Kontsevich.
  %For the former, one studies a not necessarily commutative graded ring via an analog of Serre's description for sheaves on a projective variety, while for the latter, one focuses on the dg-category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a variety.
  %Given a standard projective variety, one passes from the abelian category of coherent or quasi-coherent sheaves to its derived category, which is what we need to do to follow the edicts of physics, to understand deep but subtle connections in moduli theory, and to gain new insights into birational geometry.

  %In this commutative situation, an impressive machine has been constructed for varieties by Mukai, Bondal, Orlov, Bridgeland, and others to understand the homological algebra in terms of the geometry.
  %In particular, thanks to Orlov (and To\"{e}n and Lunts in more generality) we know that any equivalence between \(\operatorname{D}(X)\) and \(\operatorname{D}(Y)\) is an integral transform associated to a kernel on the product \(X \times Y\).
  %If we think non-commutatively, this is a derived Morita statement and we can ask if it holds for Artin-Zhang noncommutative projective schemes.
  %By imposing some standard cohomological assumptions, my work yields a positive result.

  \opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}
  
  My name is Blake Farman, and I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Lafayette College.
  I received my Ph.D. from the University of South Carolina on May 12, 2018, working under the direction of Matthew Ballard in the area of Noncommutative Projective Algebraic Geometry.
  I am writing to apply for the \position advertised on \posloc,\, which was brought to my attention by Professor Marco Aldi.
