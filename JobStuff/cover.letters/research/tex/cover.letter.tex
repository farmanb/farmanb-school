\def\researchblurb{My research lies at the intersection of Kontsevich and Artin-Zhang style noncommutative geometry, where I study the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on noncommutative projective schemes via the framework of differential graded categories.
  My dissertation provides a noncommutative definition of integral transform and proves, under appropriate cohomological assumptions, that to any equivalence between derived categories of quasi-coherent sheaves one may associate an integral transform.
  In the commutative situation, the analogous result is due to Orlov (and To\"{e}n and Lunts in more generality), and forms a corner stone for our understanding of derived categories in algebraic geometry.}
  %For a more detailed treatment, please see the enclosed research statement.}

\def\teachingblurb{As an instructor, I have a deep appreciation for the beauty and power of mathematics that I am always excited to share with students.
  I have a wealth of experience as instructor of record for undergraduate courses ranging from college algebra to calculus II.
  In addition, I have delivered guest lectures, seminars, and colloquium talks aimed at the graduate level.
  A list of courses that I have taught can be found in my curriculum vitae, and detailed information about those courses are available on my website.

\def\diversityblurb{In all the courses that I teach, I feel that it is imperative to foster an inclusive environment.
  It is my firmly held belief that everyone should have equal access to education and, along this line, I believe that traditionally underrepresented groups should be embraced and encouraged, a sentiment shared by the community at Lafayette College.
  During my time here, I have had the opportunity to review literature regarding inclusivity in STEM, and to discuss these ideas and their implementation with fellow faculty members.
  I have also taken the opportunity to participate in biweekly teaching lunches within the mathematics department, where colleagues share their philosophies and methods for fostering an inclusive and effective teaching environment.
  As a direct result, I have incorporated examples from various disciplines which are relevant to students' lives, and implemented active learning techniques to reach a wide variety of learning styles.
  I look forward to the opportunity to continuing this work as my career progresses.}
