Problem 1:

Had a hard time passing RedSeq back to my original calling function.  The parser works, but the interface isn't right, so all output is printed.    Assumed input of the form sr([3,+,5],RedSeq), etc.

Problem 2:

Only made it as far as coding the move up/down/right functions.  Renamed a lot of the variables from the other functions in the starter code as an attempt to understand the code but didn't really change the functionality.
